1. all scripts should be idempotent, and call their dependencies
2. some scripts from my project project should probably be here, and this should install project
3. use $HOME/.local/bin etc rather than $HOME/bin
4. stuff like packer/terraform (will need upgrade support too)
5. revert to vim, I'm not sure neovim adds any value at the moment and it has frequent rendering bugs
6. switch vim to vundle from pathogen
